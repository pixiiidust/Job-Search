I'm looking to connect for job and building opportunities. :)

# About Jamie

I unblock what stalls product delivery. I love connecting siloed teams, spotting misalignment before it costs months, and converting bottlenecks into leverage points. To me, empowerment means bringing ideas to life in ways that enable livelihoods.

## What I Do Best

- Translate between engineers, designers, and executives in language each understands
- Run daily execution: documentation, check-ins, tracking, follow-through
- Get hands-on when needed: run environments locally, parse JSON, identify UX constraints
- Correct projects that drift off-course before crisis
- Convert systemic chokepoints into opportunities that accelerate the entire roadmap

Products fail when teams optimize parts in silos. I orchestrate pieces into systems that click for user adoption.

## Dream Roles: Technical Product Manager / Program Manager / Product Lead

I excel where multiple teams or prototypes need integration into a coherent roadmap. Features are sequenced so each builds successively toward compounding value, not isolated launches.

**Value:** Combine hands-on execution with strategic vision. Navigate technical constraints while keeping stakeholder communication clear.

## Roles Applied To (and Felt Aligned With)

- **Technical Product Management** — systems thinking and roadmap sequencing
- **Product Operations** — cross-team execution with path to strategic ownership
- **Onboarding / Adoption PM** — retention through clarity and feedback loops

## Featured Work: Polls App with @DefenderOfBasic (Open Research Institute)

- Crowd-sensing app that maps perception gaps within attention economies
- Reveals when innovators' frontier claims clash with audience understanding
- Bridges breakthrough ideas with real-world adoption

**My role:** Product role focused on system design, UX logic, team coordination.

**Relevance:** Working model for any product dependent on taste, user feedback, or idea validation. Demonstrates ability to coordinate technical execution on novel product concepts.
